        "description": "After 1982's \"The Visitors\" ABBA quietly faded away while buzz developed over the projects each of the members pursued individually. Frida was first out of the gate with the Phil Collins produced \"I Know There's Something Going On\" peaking at #13 in the spring of 83, then Agnetha put out the sleek and sexy \"Can't Shake Loose\" that August which barely made the top 30 peaking at #29 that fall. There were rumblings that Benny and Bjorn were working on something big, a musical with Tim Rice which ate up all their time from 1983 and most of 1984. The story involves a Cold War era chess match between the US master and Russian master and their battle for the love of a woman who manages one and falls in love with the other. A concept album was released in 1984 featuring Murray Head, Tommy K\u00f6rberg, Elaine Paige, Barbara Dickson and Denis Quilley. Head (Say It Ain't So, Joe) was tapped to play the American chess master and became the vocalist on \"One Night In Bangkok\", a contemptuous look at the famed city. Murray Head (born March 5, 1946 in London, England) was found to be a musical genius while he was still in his childhood. Writing songs from that time on, he was signed to CBS in the UK by the mid-60's. Joe Wissert who had produced the 1967 #1 pop hit \"Happy Together\" for The Turtles and Helen Reddy's chart topping story of mystery, \"Angie Baby\" in 1974. In 1972 Wissert produced Murray's first LP, Nigel Lives\". By that time Murray had already recorded the main theme of \"Superstar\", from the runaway Broadway hit \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" in 1970. The WWWW radio station in Detroit used to play the Broadway cast recordings on Good Friday, between 12 and 3 PM. Murray's showstopping number became a #14 1971 pop hit in the US. In 1978, he was drawn to my attention by college radio via his rock opus \"Say It Ain't So\" 1975 LP.  The song seemed to be a scathing review of Bangkok's nightlife, was sung by Head in the middle of Act I. It created some controversy with Thailand as it apparently demeaned the city with the lyrics \"you've seen one crowded polluted city\" and \"you can go back to your bars, your temples, your massage parlours\". Thailand's Mass Communications Organization banned \"One Night in Bangkok\", saying its lyrics \"can cause misunderstanding about Thai society and shows disrespect towards Buddhism.\"  It found spots on the top 3 singles charts in many countries around the world, and did peak at #3 in the US in early 1985.  The extended version cut out the original recorded intro of an orchestral piece called \"Bangkok\". It was never long enough for me and Ive been working on it little by little since 2010 but it finally came together tonight in 3 hours. The album was a worldwide smash but theatrical productions were not as successful and several rewrites of the play have not been able to translate the drama of the US/Russian conflict into something everyone can relate to. \"One Night In Bangkok\" was also a club hit, peaking at #5 disco/dance in 1985. That is Per Lindvall from Sweden on drums here.",

        "description": "Louis-Hector Berlioz (11 December 1803 \u2013 8 March 1869) was a French Romantic composer. His output includes orchestral works such as the Symphonie fantastique and Harold in Italy, choral pieces including the Requiem and L'enfance du Christ, his three operas Benvenuto Cellini, Les Troyens and B\u00e9atrice et B\u00e9n\u00e9dict, and works of hybrid genres such as the \"dramatic symphony\" Rom\u00e9o et Juliette and the \"dramatic legend\" La damnation de Faust.\n\nThe elder son of a provincial doctor, Berlioz was expected to follow his father into medicine, and he attended a Parisian medical college before defying his family by taking up music as a profession. His independence of mind and refusal to follow traditional rules and formulas put him at odds with the conservative musical establishment of Paris. He briefly moderated his style sufficiently to win France's premier music prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1830 but he learned little from the academics of the Paris Conservatoire. Opinion was divided for many years between those who thought him an original genius and those who viewed his music as lacking in form and coherence.\n\nAt age 22 Berlioz fell in love with the Irish Shakespearean actress Harriet Smithson, and he pursued her obsessively until she finally accepted him seven years later. Their marriage was happy at first but eventually foundered. Harriet inspired his first major success, the Symphonie fantastique, in which an idealised depiction of her occurs throughout.\n\nBerlioz completed three operas, the first of which, Benvenuto Cellini, was an outright failure. The second, the huge epic Les Troyens (The Trojans), was so large in scale that it was never staged in its entirety during his lifetime. His last opera, B\u00e9atrice et B\u00e9n\u00e9dict \u2013 based on Shakespeare's comedy Much Ado About Nothing \u2013 was a success at its premiere but did not enter the regular operatic repertoire. Meeting only occasional success in France as a composer, Berlioz increasingly turned to conducting, in which he gained an international reputation. He was highly regarded in Germany, Britain and Russia both as a composer and as a conductor. To supplement his earnings he wrote musical journalism throughout much of his career; some of it has been preserved in book form, including his Treatise on Instrumentation (1844), which was influential in the 19th and 20th centuries. Berlioz died in Paris at the age of 65.\n\nHector Berlioz\n\nTracklist:\nCarnaval romano\n1. Carnaval Romano, Op. 9\nSinfonia Fant\u00e1stica, Op. 14, \"Epis\u00f3dio da Vida de um Artista\"\n2.

Vivo  17:18\n\nCarlos Prieto, cello\nBerlin Symphony Orchestra\nJorge Velazco, conductor\n\nRicardo Castro Herrera (Rafael de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad Castro Herrera) (7 February 1864, Hacienda de santa B\u00e1rbara, Durango -- 27 November 1907, Mexico City) was a Mexican concert pianist and composer, considered the last romantic of the time of Porfirio D\u00edaz.\n\nCastro's father, Vicente Castro, was a deputy congressman; his mother was Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas Herrera. Castro began his music education with Pedro H. Ceniseros. In 1879 his family moved to Mexico City where the boy entered the National Conservatory of Music and studied piano with Juan Salvatierra and Julio Ituarte, He studied harmony and counterpoint with Melesio Morales. He finished all his studies just in 5 years, half of the usual 10. He graduated in 1883.\n\nCastro began his musical career as a concert pianist and composer before finishing his studies. In 1882, he won two prizes. At 19, Castro finished his First Symphony in C Minor; the symphony was premiered in 1988, 81 years after his death.\n\nIn 1883 the Government of Mexico chose some of Castro's works to send to Venezuela for the Simon Bolivar centenary and later in 1884 he made a concert tour through United States.\n\nCastro received a scholarship from the Government of Mexico and went to Europe from 1903 to 1906 to give master classes in conservatories in Paris, Brussels, Rome, Milan and Leipzig. He published in Paris many Mexican dances for piano in the Habanera style. He studied with Teresa Carre\u00f1o while in Europe. When he returned to Mexico he was appointed music director of the National Conservatory of Music by Justo Sierra and kept that work until he died of pneumonia in November,1907.\n\nCastro's music for piano tends to be very colourful and sentimental with a kind of virtuosity in the style of Liszt. He often connects many musical themes in brilliant passages of virtuosity.\n\nThe Cello Concerto in C minor is the first work in its genre by a Mexican composer.  It was composed around 1895, and premiered by Marix Loevensohn in Paris at the Salle Erard in 1903.  However, it wasn't heard in Mexico until 1981, when Carlos Prieto played it at the Sala Nezahualcoyotl with Jorge Velazco conducting the Mineria Orchestra.",
